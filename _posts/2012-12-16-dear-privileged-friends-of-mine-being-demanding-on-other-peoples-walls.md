There&#8217;s utility to having different conversations with different groups of people, at different levels of knowledge. When someone posts something on their own goddamn wall they get to decide who they&#8217;re looking to have a conversation with. They don&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t owe you shit.

Hierarchies of knowledge and experience are shitty, and feedback loops that reinforce these suck, which is why everyone should make an effort in their life to be aware of these myriad processes and try to help explain and teach other people, especially those individuals without other/good avenues of gaining that information. **But**. This does not mean doing that all the time, in every conversation. Or even most of them.

Here&#8217;s some good internet etiquette: Inquire once if someone could explain or pass a link. If they say they no, recognize this conversation isn&#8217;t for you, and that&#8217;s not necessarily them trying to play catty popularity games of excluding you, it&#8217;s just a frustrating reality of specialized knowledge and our society&#8217;s insufficiently developed communications technologies. Perfectly decent people need space / separate audiences sometimes. Don&#8217;t derail the conversation they were trying to have by expressing your frustration, take the hint and shut the fuck up.

When someone posts something in public do not assume they have you in mind as their intended audience, or that they SHOULD. Sometimes them not considering you is rooted in fucked up dynamics. When someone implies quite strongly that their audience is Everyone or Everyone That Matters (like for example a very public newspaper article), that&#8217;s obviously obnoxious and can contribute to the institutionalization of oppressive dynamics.

Closed minds suck. We should always be exploring beyond our horizons as well as exploring the framing context, chance and individual particulars behind our own journey to assist others rather than pulling the ladder up behind us. But someone not willing to drop everything to talk with you right now doesn&#8217;t neccessarily mean they have a closed mind.
