There are a lot of important events and struggles that I let slide by without commenting on in this blog. In general I don&#8217;t see much point in echoing opinions or knowledge shared widely enough to be assured of capable handling. I have never been the type compelled to publicly register outrage at every new injustice. I figure some shit goes without saying and any marginal benefit to one additional voice is outweighed by the danger of such boring outcry drowning more original or challenging content. Yet sometimes there actually are opportunities to substantively help, this is one of them. [The arrest of Jeremy Hammond](http://freehammond.com/) has been an objectively huge blow to the cause of liberty.

There are few enough good anarchists and good hackers. Fewer still have done the often grueling work to build and positively influence the nascent cyber-liberation movement. The cultural turn often represented by Anonymous is still more loose momentum than hard substance and I worry constantly about its dissipation. This is a struggle that matters, that actually shakes the foundations of the nationstate system and it is a struggle so on the edge that every single additional contribution helps. Jeremy is a hero. Not just because he&#8217;s an overall saint of an anarchist activist (it&#8217;s kinda insane how one could hardly ask for a better CV), but in particular because his vigilant drive to do the best possible thing regardless of personal cost led him to seek out, find and play a momentous role.

His arrest is a blow. But we can turn this around. A movement&#8217;s strength lies in its solidarity and prisoner support is no small part of this. We can influence how this plays out. Jeremy&#8217;s been dragged by the feds to New York. Previously having served years in jail _twice_ left him with the experience of being explicitly betrayed by a shitbag lawyer. Prisoner support is often unglamorous; however much martyrs tug at our heartstrings there&#8217;s sometimes an impulse to focus on the living. There are many important projects, goals and means we can and should spend our energy and money on, but this isn&#8217;t just about paying dividends to one of our own for their sacrifice. The state has to know that we&#8217;ve got each others&#8217; backs at least this much or else the smell of weakness will overwhelm their nostrils and the bullshit provocations, the trumped up lies, the fishing expeditions will increase. This isn&#8217;t about stuffing cash into the unfillable pockets of some lawyer in some yet another legal battle that leeches the rest of us dry. This is about paying for support groups capable of working from the same state he&#8217;s in. This is about the cost of stamps at the prison commissary. Every human hand of outreach to Jeremy is a defiant fist in the face of a cop. [Please donate](http://freehammond.com/) and please spread the word or convey how important this is to those who might.
