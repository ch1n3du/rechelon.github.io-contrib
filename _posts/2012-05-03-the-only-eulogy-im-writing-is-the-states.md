One of my oldest friends, probably the comrade I&#8217;ve known the longest beside my dad, was [arrested this morning by armed thugs and charged with literally 72 felonies](https://greycoast.wordpress.com/2012/05/03/portland-house-raided-comrade-arrested-courtroom-solidarity-call/). It&#8217;s a ridiculous nuke intended to be heard around the country, much like the FBI frame job of five in Cleveland two days ago, and just as preposterous. But what it means is yet another friend might be going to jail for a very long time. The shy transfer student I argued into anarchism almost a decade ago in long raucous sessions while skipping class, the person who, during those long dark years when I had almost entirely withdrawn from society, gave me a place to sleep, a sense of home, and shared their friends, resolutely dragging the most amazing wonderful people to hang out with my hollow, sullen and cantankerously heretical ass. Almost everyone I love, every relationship I cherish in the movement today I owe in part to Pax.

When they broke down Pax&#8217;s door it was &#8216;two years into an investigation.&#8217;

It&#8217;s sad how comfortable we get with this war we&#8217;re in. How analytical and distant, how unsurprising everything is. Just another minor, almost inevitable move on an almost trivial part of the vast chessboard. How everything lives within us at once without turbulence. I want to cry, hell, I want to sob for hours. I want to hug everyone in town as deeply and warmly as any hug can be. I want to pledge vengeance in giant burning letters that dwarf downtown. I want to see Pax radiating wry cheer and high-five them at the success of \*seventy two\* counts. I want to immediately have desperate strategy conversations with certain individuals because jesus fuck this has implications, although I know that frankly we all have more important things to be working on right now. Every time they take a friend from us it&#8217;s like a punch you knew was coming. With oh so many more eventually to come. They&#8217;re going to take nearly all of us before this war is done. But it will be fucking done one day. That&#8217;s what I have to say. Nothing about dancing on the ruins or piles of dead or any such cheap dramatic imagery.

One day it will be done.
