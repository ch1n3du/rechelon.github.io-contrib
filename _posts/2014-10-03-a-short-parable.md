I&#8217;m standing over a howling chasm while three anarchists clutch to the edge. The computational problem of collective decisionmaking whips and batters our loose clothes. _&#8220;Come on! Take my hand!&#8221;_ I scream above the wind. _&#8220;You don&#8217;t know the power of markets! We can use them for good! Join me and together we will destroy the ancaps and finally bring a potent anarchism to the world.&#8221;_

_&#8220;Meetings aren&#8217;t that bad. You&#8217;re just antisocial. What would be so wrong with having to talk things out forever?&#8221;_ says one comrade and lets go.

_&#8220;Look maybe we **like** being inefficient. Maybe being effective at doing stuff is what&#8217;s caused all the problems we have,&#8221;_ says another comrade and lets go.

_&#8220;It may be the case that forms of centralized organizing that don&#8217;t force results upon people don&#8217;t get much done, but see this is why we vote on shit and let the Leninists make all the big decisions,&#8221;_ says the last one, _&#8220;it&#8217;s important not to fall to partisanship. Humility about our foundational ideals is the best way to maintain a mass coalition capable of eventually doing an undefined thing utterly at odds with said ideals. Honestly I feel more at home among state communists than with most anarchists.&#8221;_ And I kick him into the chasm.
